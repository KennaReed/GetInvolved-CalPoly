Here is some documentation to connect to our database!

1) Login to MongoDB Atlas account: https://account.mongodb.com/account/login

2) I sent you the invitation when I first made it, so you should already see it 
   Note: You don't need to do anything here, but it might be helpful for you to see what the other side looks like.
   
3) Make sure you pull my files from github. From in the branch you are working on: git pull origin main

4) cd until you are level with my postBackend.py file and your venv folder

5) create a .env file

6) Paste this into your .env file replacing <Username> and <Password> with what I sent you in the chat
    DB_LINK=mongodb+srv://<UserName>:<Password>@csc-308-teamd.crp9s.mongodb.net/Posts?retryWrites=true&w=majority&ssl=true&ssl_cert_reqs=CERT_NONE
    PORT=3001
    
    Note: Ideally, you should not need the &ssl=true&ssl_cert_reqs=CERT_NONE, but for some wack reason I needed it, so maybe try with and without it to see if it works for you.

7) Run these Commands:
<<<<<<< HEAD
   $ pip install python-dotenv
   $pip install -U python-dotenv
   $. venv/bin/activate
   $python -m pip install pymongo[tls]
   $pip install dnspython
   $export FLASK_APP=postBackend.py
   $export FLASK_ENV=development
   $flask run
   
 8) Now in Boomerang (like we used in class), GET at this url: http://127.0.0.1:5000/posts and SEND. That should output all of the example posts I put in the database. 
 
 Note: As of writing this, that is the only endpoint I have set up, but I am doing more this week, so I will let you know as I get them up.
Update: There is now filtering functionality.
